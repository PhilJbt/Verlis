## Rules

- Once a day (the countdown is visible in the menu), a new verb to guess is chosen at random from a list of <strong>12,164</strong>;
- The verbs proposed must be verbs in <strong>the selected language</strong>, in the <strong>infinitive</strong>;
- The accentuation (if applicable) of the letters <strong>must be</strong> respected;
- There is <strong>no limit</strong> on time or number of attempts;
- A diamond, after a verb, is divided vertically into two parts. Each represents the number of similar letters at the beginning or end of a word. Here are some examples:<br/>
	- <strong>$${\color{#ff9c00}&#9671;}$$</strong> would mean <strong>no letters</strong> at the beginning or end of a word are similar.<br/>
	- <strong>$${\color{#ff9c00}5 &#11030;}$$</strong> would mean that the <strong>first five</strong> letters of the word are similar.<br/>
	- <strong>$${\color{#ff9c00}&#11031; 3}$$</strong> would mean that the <strong>last three</strong> letters of the word are similar.<br/>
	- <strong>$${\color{#ff9c00}4 &#9670; 2}$$</strong> would mean that the <strong>first four</strong> and <strong>last two</strong> letters of the word are similar.<br/>
	- Again, in French, diacritics do not affect the count.<br/>
	- You can enable these hints in the <strong><em>Options</em></strong> menu.

<br/>

## Keyboard keys

- The <em>Return</em> &#11176; key validates the proposal of a verb;
- The <em>Up Arrow</em> &#11205; key writes the last word tried (valid or not) in the text box;
- The <em>Down Arrow</em> &#11206; key deletes the contents of the text box.
